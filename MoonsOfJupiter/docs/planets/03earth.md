### History and Observation

Earth is often said to be discovered by *literally everyone ever*, but modern civilization really got to know it once maps became a thing.

### Physical Characteristics

Earth is a geologically active planet with mountains, rivers, forests, deserts, and lots of things that sting or bite.

### Orbit and Rotation

Earth’s axis is tilted at about 23.5°, giving us seasons. It completes one orbit around the Sun every 365.25 days, leading to leap years.

### Moons

Earth has one moon, which is responsible for tides, occasional werewolf sightings, and romantic moonlit walks.

### Atmosphere and Climate

Earth has a dynamic climate system with varied weather patterns and seasonal changes, perfect for everything from sunbathing to building snowmen.

### Human Exploration

Humans have explored almost all of Earth, and there are no plans to leave (yet).

### Cultural Significance

Earth has been central to most human myths, religions, and sci-fi movies. Also, it’s home.

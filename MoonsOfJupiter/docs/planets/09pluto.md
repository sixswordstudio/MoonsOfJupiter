### Discovery

Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory.

### History and Observation

Pluto was considered the ninth planet until 2006, when it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the IAU. It’s still bitter about it.

### Physical Characteristics

Pluto is the largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System, with a rocky core surrounded by ice.

### Orbit and Rotation

Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune. It takes 248 Earth years to complete one orbit.

### Moons

Pluto has five moons, with Charon being the largest. Charon is so large relative to Pluto that they are sometimes considered a double dwarf planet system.

### Atmosphere and Climate

Pluto’s atmosphere is thin and composed mainly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.

### Human Exploration

NASA’s New Horizons mission flew by Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up images of its surface.

### Cultural Significance

Pluto remains a beloved underdog in the Solar System, with many advocating for its return to full planet status.
